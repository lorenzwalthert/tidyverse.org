```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")
```

Today, I wanted to talk a little bit about the renewed `rowwise()` function that makes it easy to perform operations "row-by-row". I'll show how you can use `rowwise()` to compute summaries "by row", talk about how `rowwise()` is a natural pairing with list-columns, and show a couple of use cases that I think are particularly elegant. You can learn more about all of these topics in  [`vignette("rowwise")`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/rowwise.html).

**Update**: as of June 1, dplyr 1.0.0 is now available on CRAN! Read [all about  it](/blog/2020/06/dplyr-1-0-0/) or install it now with `install.packages("dplyr")`.

## Basic operation

`rowwise()` works like `group_by()` in the sense that it doesn't change what the data looks like; it changes how dplyr verbs operate on the data. Let's see how this works with a simple example. Here I have some imaginary test results for students in a class:

```{r}
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)

df <- tibble(
  student_id = 1:4,
  test1 = 10:13,
  test2 = 20:23,
  test3 = 30:33,
  test4 = 40:43
)
df
```

I'd like to be able to compute the mean of the test scores for each student, but `mutate()` and `mean()` don't do what I want:

```{r}
df %>% mutate(avg = mean(c(test1, test2, test3, test4)))
```

The problem is that I'm getting a mean over the whole data frame, not for each student. I can resolve this problem of getting a mean for each student by creating a "row-wise" data frame with `rowwise()`:

```{r}
rf <- rowwise(df, student_id)
```

`rowwise()` doesn't need any additional arguments unless you have variables that identify the rows, like `student_id` here. Much like grouping variables, identifier variables will be automatically preserved when you `summarise()` the data.

```{r}
rf
```

`rf` _looks_ very similar to `df`, but _behaves_ very differently:

```{r}
rf %>% mutate(avg = mean(c(test1, test2, test3, test4)))
```
An additional advantage of `rowwise()` is that it's paired with [`c_across()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/dev/reference/across.html), which works like `c()` but uses the same tidyselect syntax as `across()`. That makes it easy to operate on multiple variables:

```{r}
rf %>% mutate(avg = mean(c_across(starts_with("test"))))
```
### Other ways of achieving the same result

Some summary functions have alternative ways of computing row-wise summaries that take advantage of built-in vectorisation. For example, if you wanted to compute the sum, you could use `+`:

```{r}
df %>% mutate(total = test1 + test2 + test3 + test4)
```
And you _could_ use the same basic idea to compute the mean:

```{r}
df %>% mutate(avg = (test1 + test2 + test3 + test4) / 4)
```

Another family of summary functions have "parallel" extensions where you can provide multiple variables in the arguments:

```{r}
df %>% mutate(
  min = pmin(test1, test2, test3, test4),
  max = pmax(test1, test2, test3, test4),
  string = paste(test1, test2, test3, test4, sep = "-")
)
```

Where these functions exist, they'll usually be faster than `rowwise()`. The advantage of `rowwise()` is that it works with any function, not just those that are already vectorised.

## List-columns

`rowwise()` is useful for computing simple summaries, but its real power comes when you use it with list-columns. Because lists can contain anything, you can use list-columns to keep related objects together, regardless of what type of thing they are. List-columns give you a convenient storage mechanism and `rowwise()` gives you a convenient computation mechanism.

Let's make those ideas concrete by creating a data frame with a list-column. A little later, we'll come back to how you might actually get a list-column in a more realistic situation. The following data frame uses list columns to store things that would otherwise be challenging:

* `x` contains vectors of different lengths.
* `y` contains vectors of different types
* `z` contains functions, which can't usually live in a data frame.

```{r}
df <- tibble(
  x = list(1, 2:3, 4:6),
  y = list(TRUE, 1, "a"),
  z = list(sum, mean, sd)
)
df
```

When you have list-columns in a row-wise data frame, you can easily compute with each element of the list:

```{r}
df %>%
  rowwise() %>%
  summarise(
    x_length = length(x),
    y_type = typeof(y),
    z_call = z(1:5)
  )
```

This makes a row-wise `mutate()` or `summarise()` a general vectorisation tool, in the same way as the apply family in base R or the map family in purrr do. It's now much simpler to solve a number of problems where we previously recommended learning about `map()`, `map2()`, `pmap()` and friends.

## Use cases

To finish up, I wanted to show off a couple of use cases where I think `rowwise()` provides a really elegant solution: simulations and modelling.

### Simulation

The basic idea of using `rowwise()` to perform simulation is to store all your simulation paramters in a data frame:

```{r}
df <- tribble(
  ~id, ~n, ~min, ~max,
  1, 3, 0, 1,
  2, 2, 10, 100,
  3, 2, 100, 1000,
)
```

Then you can either generate a list-column containing the simulated values with `mutate()`:

```{r}
df %>%
  rowwise(id) %>%
  mutate(data = list(runif(n, min, max)))
```

Or take advantage of [`summarise()`'s new capabilities](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2020/03/dplyr-1-0-0-summarise/) and return one element per row: 

```{r}
df %>%
  rowwise(id) %>%
  summarise(x = runif(n, min, max))
```

Note that `id` is preserved in the output here because we defined it as an identifier variable in the call to `rowwise()`.

[`vignette("rowwise")`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/dev/articles/rowwise.html#repeated-function-calls-1) expands on this idea to show how you can generate parameter grids and vary the random distribution used in each row.

### Group-wise models

The new `nest_by()` function works similarly to `group_by()` but instead of storing the grouping data as metadata, visibly changes the structure. Now we have three rows (one for each group), and we have a list-col, `data`, that stores the data for that group. Also note that the output is a `rowwise()` object; this is important because itâ€™s going to make working with that list of data frames much easier.

```{r}
by_cyl <- mtcars %>% nest_by(cyl)
by_cyl
```

Now we can use `mutate()` to fit a model to each data frame:

```{r}
by_cyl <- by_cyl %>% mutate(model = list(lm(mpg ~ wt, data = data)))
by_cyl
```

(Note that we need to wrap the output of `lm()` into a list; if you forget this, the error message will remind you.)

And then extract model summaries or coefficients with `summarise()` and [broom](http://broom.tidyverse.org/) functions:

```{r}
by_cyl %>% summarise(broom::glance(model))

by_cyl %>% summarise(broom::tidy(model))
```
